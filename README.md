Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the proccess of creating websites and applications using code, it's important to the tech industry cause it helps build everything we use on devices.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages, rise of agile methodologies, and structured programming. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Design planning the software architecture, implementation writing the code, testing making sure it's functional, deployment putting out the program, maintenance ensuring it works and fixing errors.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Both of them are useful ways of working, Agile is more flexible and would work better when doing projects with less time constraint, while Waterfall is strict and can be used better when doing something that requires quick turnout.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software devoloper writes code, quality assurance engineer tests the codes quality, and project manager oversees the project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs let you create test and debug code eg. VScode. VCS tracks changes to the source code eg. Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines are on of the common challenges faced and restructuring the work can help push it out faster.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components, intergration testing is testing interactions between different components, system testing is testing the system as a whole, and acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of structuring questions to ensure AI models provide the best responses, it's important cause it helps make AI interactions less confusing.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
French foods to make. An improved version would be, simple French breakfast dishes to make. The prompt is better cause its more specific now.
